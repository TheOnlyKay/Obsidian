# Backstory

### Kaelion Sylren - The Starborn Seeker
Kaelion Sylren was born under a sky of **falling stars**, a celestial omen that foretold great significance. The **Skywatchers of the High Forest**, an ancient tribe of wood elves, believed that the heavens wove the tapestry of fate, and those who could read the stars, could catch glimpses of the future. It was said that those born under extraordinary celestial events were destined for something great- something extraordinary. This meant that Kaelion's destiny was intertwined with the stars themselves, as if Kaelion was written into the very fabric of the cosmos. From a young age they have felt this connection deep in their bones, as though the heavens themselves were speaking directly to Kaelion.

Growing up in the heart of the **High Forest**, a vast and untouched wilderness, Kaelion was drawn to the mysteries of the night sky. As a child, they would often wander from the safety of their family's home, slipping into the cool night air to gaze up at the stars. With every nightfall, they felt the pull of the sky-its patterns, its hidden meanings. Kaelion would trace constellations, carefully sketching the observations into an old, worn journal, convinced that each star held a secret to be discovered. These quiet, solitary moments under the vast canopy of stars were Kaelion's greatest joy, and it was during these nights that they first met **[[Eluna Stormwhisper]]**, a fellow Skywatcher apprentice.

### Eluna - The Guiding Light
Eluna was everything that Kaelion wasn't. Where Kaelion was intuitive, feeling their way through the mysteries of the world, Eluna was meticulous, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a determination to understand the hidden truths of the stars. Unlike the rest of the tribe, who seemed to grasp the celestial arts with natural ease, Eluna had to work tirelessly to connect with the heavens. Yet it was this very dedication that Kaelion admired-Eluna's drive was infectious, and the two quickly became inseparable. They spent their days together, training in the druidic arts, learning how to speak to the land and commune with the natural world. Their nights were spent mapping the heavens, tracing the paths of the stars, searching for meaning in the ever-changing sky.

The bond between Kaelion and Eluna grew stronger with each passing season. The two were more than companions; they were partners, friends, and, perhaps unknowingly, two souls bound by the very stars they studied. They often spoke about destiny and adventure, dreaming of the day they would leave the High Forest behind, exploring the world beyond the trees. Eluna, more than anyone, understood Kaelion's deep connection to the celestial world and was always there to challenge their assumptions, push them to learn more, to see beyond the obvious.

Eluna was Kaelion's light in the darkness- the one person who knew Kaelion inside and out, who shared their passion for the stars and their dreams of a world full of discovery. Together they were unstoppable, a force that seemed destined for greatness.

But as the seasons passed, something ominous began to stir in the heavens. The stars seemed to shift, becoming restless, as if preparing to reveal something the world was not ready to know.

### The Night of the Omen
One evening, as Kaelion and Eluna gazed up at the sky, a sudden flash of light caught their attention. An unfamiliar constellation flickered into existence, its patterns unlike any Kaelion had seen before. At first, it was faint, a brief flash of light among the familiar stars. But then it pulsed, a steady, rhythmic glow that seemed to pulse with an unspoken energy. Kaelion's heart skipped a beat, there was something deeply wrong with the stars that night, something they couldn't explain, yet it gnawed at Kaelion's very soul.

Kaelion turned to Eluna, seeking answers, but the look in their companion's eyes mirrored the same unease Kaelion felt. Eluna was already searching for her quarterstaff, her eyes scanning the trees. She could sense it too. The sense of foreboding was **palpable**, hanging in the air like a heavy fog.

Before Kaelion could speak, they felt it- a sudden and overwhelming **sense of loss**, as though the very stars were trying to communicate something urgent. They looked around to find Eluna, calling out her name, but Eluna was gone, their usual spot, beneath the ancient oak tree where they had spent countless nights together, was empty. There were no signs, no clues- only an eerie silence. The stars overhead flickered and dimmed, as if to mark her absence.

Frantic, Kaelion searched the forest for days, rallying others from the tribe to help. They combed the wilderness, scouring every familiar trail. every nook and cranny where Eluna could have gone. Yet, despite their efforts, there was no sign of Eluna. Days turned to weeks, and still, no trace of her could be found. The tribe began to whisper, their voices filled with suspicion and dread. Some believed Eluna had been taken by **dark forces**, others thought she had simply wandered too far and perished. But Kaelion knew the truth deep in their heart: the stars had tried to warn them, but they had failed to understand.

The very omen that had signaled Eluna's disappearance was a mystery in itself, a cosmic puzzle that Kaelion could not solve. But they were sure of one thing: the stars had not just guided Eluna away- they had chosen her for something, something Kaelion was not meant to know.

### The Withdrawal
Kaelion was consumed by guilt and sorrow. They could not bear the thought of continuing their life among the tribe while Eluna's fate remained uncertain. For years, Kaelion isolated themselves from the tribe, retreating into the deep wilds of the High Forest. There, they found solace only in the company of the land and the sky- the whispering winds and the distant stars seemed to call out to them, ever so faintly. They spent their days meditating, their nights tracing constellations in the hopes that one day, they would find the answer to what happened to Eluna.

Time passed, but Kaelion's heart remained broken. Memories of Eluna haunted their every step, and every night beneath the stars felt like a reminder of what had been lost. Yet Kaelion couldn't stop searching, even as the world outside the forest moved on.

### The Return of the Omen
Now, years later, Kaelion's heart has stirred once again. The strange constellation that had flickered into existence the night Eluna vanished has reappeared, brighter and more intense than ever before. Its light pulses with an unspoken message, one Kaelion feels deep within their bones- this is no coincidence. The time has come. The stars are calling again, but this time, Kaelion knows they cannot ignore their summons.

The mourning is over, and the stars have not forgotten them. With their quarterstaff in hand, a new resolve has taken root within Kaelion. They must seek the truth, no matter the cost. The search for Eluna is no longer just a matter of grief- it is a quest for understanding, for redemption, and for the cosmic answers that have eluded them for so long.

With the wisdom of the heavens as their guide, Kaelion steps beyond the forest's borders, ready to follow the stars wherever they may lead. Whether the path leads to redemption or ruin, Kaelion will no longer hide from the truth. The stars have spoken, and Kaelion will answer.

# Character Quirks
1. **Starry-Eyed Dreamer** - Kaelion often loses themselves staring at the night sky, mid-conversation, mid-battle, or even mid-bite. They'll pause, eyes locked on a constellation, muttering, "*Strange... that star wasnt there last week*"
2. **Symbolic Rituals** - Kaelion has a habit of **drawing constellations in the dirt** or carving them into wood when deep in thought. When nervous, they might trace a star shape on their wrist with their finger.
3. **Cryptic but Playful** - They have a way of speaking in vague, mysterious phrases, even when it's unnecessary
	1. "*The stars whisper of many paths... but sure, let's take the left one*"
	2. They sometimes exaggerate their "mystical wisdom" to mess with people, only to wink after.
4. **Odd Sleeping Habits** - Kaelion **sleeps outside whenever possible**, even if there's a perfectly good inn, they'd rather be under the stars. Indoors, they position themselves by a windows, restless if they can't see the night sky.
5. **Celestial Cooking** - They like to **align their meals with the phases of the moon** (e.g. only eating certain herbs or brewing specific teas during certain lunar cycles.) Whether or not it actually changes anything... well, they insist it does.
6. **Unshakably Calm... Until they don't have their Quarterstaff**  -Kaelion is typically serene and wise, but if someone misplaces or damages their **quarterstaff** (which they hand-carved with star patterns together with Eluna), they get **unexpectedly flustered** and dramatic.

# Parental Relationships

Sylwen is a Druid and a Skywatcher Elder

- A **stoic and wise** elven woman, deeply respected in the tribe for her celestial readings and connection to the land.

- Kaelion **adores her but also resents the pressure** she placed on them, feeling as though their destiny was decided before they could choose.
- She never fully approved of Kaelion's deep bond with **Eluna**, believing their friendship was a distraction from their sacred duties.

## Father - Therion Sylren

- He **told Kaelion stories of the stars** not just as cosmic fate, but as legends of adventure, heroes, and fools who dared to challenge destiny.
- Unlike Sylwen, he **encouraged Kaelion's curiosity** and independence, often sneaking them out of ritual lessons to watch meteor showers together.
- He was **Kaelion's emotional anchor**, balancing their mother's discipline with humor and love
- His **death** is something Kaelion rarely talks about, perhaps it was the first time they felt like the stars had truly abandoned them.
