**Race:** Wood Elf  
**Class:** Druid
**Role:** Apprentice Seeker, Aspiring Starwatcher, Close Friend to Kaelion

### **Early Life and Struggles**  
Eluna was born into the **Skywatcher Tribe**, a group of wood elves who revered the stars and the natural world, believing that the heavens held important lessons and guidance. From a young age, Eluna was drawn to the night sky—an endless expanse full of mysteries waiting to be unlocked. However, unlike some of her peers, who seemed to understand the stars and their meanings instinctively, Eluna had to **work hard** to understand their language.

She wasn’t born with the innate celestial connection many members of her tribe seemed to possess, and at first, she felt somewhat **alienated** from the other children who shared a natural understanding of the stars’ patterns and movements. Still, Eluna wasn’t the type to back down from a challenge. She spent hours on end, both during the day and at night, studying the stars, asking the tribe’s elders questions, and practicing rituals in hopes of finding a deeper connection to the celestial forces. The process was slow, and while she did begin to make sense of the constellations, she was still a long way from truly understanding the mysteries of the stars.

Despite her **struggles**, Eluna’s **determination** to learn was undeniable. She wasn’t an instant prodigy, but through sheer persistence and patience, she became a solid part of the **younger generation of Skywatchers**. While she didn’t hold any official role or title, she was known within the tribe as someone who always asked the **right questions**—someone who was dedicated to learning even if she hadn’t quite unlocked the secrets the stars held. Eluna was **still an apprentice** when she left the tribe, focused on the **quest for understanding**, but not yet an influential figure within the Skywatcher Tribe.

### **Her Relationship with Kaelion**

Kaelion and Eluna’s bond was formed over their shared interest in the stars. While Kaelion always had a natural connection to the world around them, Eluna’s interest was born of **curiosity** and a desire to find meaning. Kaelion admired Eluna’s **tenacity**, seeing in her a reflection of their own **dedication** to understanding the world in a way that felt deeply personal.

Though they didn’t always agree on the best path forward, their relationship was one of **mutual respect** and camaraderie. They often spent nights **together under the stars**, discussing the movements of celestial bodies and wondering about the great mysteries of the universe. Kaelion sometimes found Eluna's fascination with **understanding everything** to be a bit obsessive, but they respected her search for meaning and the **questions she wasn’t afraid to ask**, no matter how uncomfortable. In turn, Eluna appreciated Kaelion’s more **intuitive approach** to the world, admiring the way they found balance without always needing to question or rationalize everything.
