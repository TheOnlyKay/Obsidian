# Backstory
Kaelion Sylren was born under a sky of falling stars, a celestial omen among the **Skywatchers of the High Forest**. Their tribe believed the heavens wove the tapestry of fate, and those who could read the stars could see a glimpse of the future. Since early childhood Kaelion has been fascinated by the night sky, spending hours tracing constellations and seeking meaning in their ever changing patterns. Their greatest joy was sharing these quiet nights with **[[Eluna Stormwhisper]]**, their closest companion - a fellow Skywatcher and the only person who truly understood them.

**Eluna** was Kaelion's guiding light, both in tribe and in life. The two were inseparable, spending their days training the druidic arts, and their nights mapping the heavens together. They spoke of destiny, of adventure, of the day they would leave the High Forest to explore the world beyond. But fate, ever cruel, had other plans.

One fateful evening, the stars burned brighter than Kaelion had ever seen. An unfamiliar constellation flickered into existence, and with it came a deep, unshakable dread. Kaelion rushed to find Eluna, only to discover that she had vanished without a trace. Search parties scoured the woods, but days turned into weeks, and no sign of her was ever found. Some whispered that she had been taken by dark forces, others believed she had wandered too far and perished. But Kaelion knew in their heart that the stars had tried to warn them, and Kaelion had failed to understand.

Wrecked by guilt and sorrow, Kaelion could no longer bear to stay among their people. They left the tribe behind and sought solitude deep in the untouched wilds, turning to the land and sky for answers. Years passed in isolation, their only companions the whispering wind and the cold, distant stars.

But now, the stars have begun to shift once more. The same, strange constellation that appeared the night Eluna vanished has returned, its light pulsing with an unspoken message. Kaelion knows this is no coincidence. The time for mourning is over - **they must seek the truth**.

Taking up their quarterstaff and the wisdom of the heavens, Kaelion sets out once more. Whether it leads to redemption or ruin, they will follow the stars wherever they may guide them.

# Character Quirks
1. **Starry-Eyed Dreamer** - Kaelion often loses themselves staring at the night sky, mid-conversation, mid-battle, or even mid-bite. They'll pause, eyes locked on a constellation, muttering, "*Strange... that star wasnt there last week*"
2. **Symbolic Rituals** - Kaelion has a habit of **drawing constellations in the dirt** or carving them into wood when deep in thought. When nervous, they might trace a star shape on their wrist with their finger.
3. **Cryptic but Playful** - They have a way of speaking in vague, mysterious phrases, even when it's unnecessary
	1. "*The stars whisper of many paths... but sure, let's take the left one*"
	2. They sometimes exaggerate their "mystical wisdom" to mess with people, only to wink after.
4. **Odd Sleeping Habits** - Kaelion **sleeps outside whenever possible**, even if there's a perfectly good inn, they'd rather be under the stars. Indoors, they position themselves by a windows, restless if they can't see the night sky.
5. **Celestial Cooking** - They like to **align their meals with the phases of the moon** (e.g. only eating certain herbs or brewing specific teas during certain lunar cycles.) Whether or not it actually changes anything... well, they insist it does.
6. **Unshakably Calm... Until they don't have their Quarterstaff**  -Kaelion is typically serene and wise, but if someone misplaces or damages their **quarterstaff** (which they hand-carved with star patterns together with Eluna), they get **unexpectedly flustered** and dramatic.

# Parental Relationships
## Mother - Sylwen Starbloom
Sylwen is a Druid and a Skywatcher Elder

- A **stoic and wise** elven woman, deeply respected in the tribe for her celestial readings and connection to the land.
- She was **a guiding but distant presence** in Kaelion's life, expecting them to embrace their role as a druid and protector of the stars.
- Kaelion **adores her but also resents the pressure** she placed on them, feeling as though their destiny was decided before they could choose.
- She never fully approved of Kaelion's deep bond with **Eluna**, believing their friendship was a distraction from their sacred duties.

## Father - Therion Sylren
Therion was a Hunter and Storyteller

- A **warm, charming**, and somewhat carefree hunter who believed that wile the stars guide, *people make their own choices*.
- He **told Kaelion stories of the stars** not just as cosmic fate, but as legends of adventure, heroes, and fools who dared to challenge destiny.
- Unlike Sylwen, he **encouraged Kaelion's curiosity** and independence, often sneaking them out of ritual lessons to watch meteor showers together.
- He was **Kaelion's emotional anchor**, balancing their mother's discipline with humor and love
- His **death** is something Kaelion rarely talks about, perhaps it was the first time they felt like the stars had truly abandoned them.


## Relationships and Bonds
1. **Eluna (Lost Loved One)**
	1. Their **best friend, possibly first love** Kaelion lost. Their disappearance still haunts Kaelion.
	2. Shared a love for the **stars, adventure, and fate**, but where Kaelion was cautious, Eluna was **bold, reckless, and always chasing the unknown**.
	3. Their final conversation before disappearing was a **disagreement about destiny**, Kaelion saw omens in the stars, while Eluna **refused to be bound by fate**.
	4. Now, Kaelion wonders: *Was she right? Did she escape fate... or become a victim of it*.
