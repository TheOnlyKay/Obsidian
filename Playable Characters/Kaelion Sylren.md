# Backstory
Kaelion Sylren was born under a sky of falling stars, a celestial omen among the **Skywatchers of the High Forest**. Their tribe believed the heavens wove the tapestry of fate, and those who could read the stars could see a glimpse of the future. Since early childhood Kaelion has been fascinated by the night sky, spending hours tracing constellations and seeking meaning in their ever changing patterns. Their greatest joy was sharing these quiet nights with **[[Eluna Stormwhisper]]**, their closest companion - a fellow Skywatcher and the only person who truly understood them.

**Eluna** was Kaelion's guiding light, both in tribe and in life. The two were inseparable, spending their days training the druidic arts, and their nights mapping the heavens together. They spoke of destiny, of adventure, of the day they would leave the High Forest to explore the world beyond. But fate, ever cruel, had other plans.

One fateful evening, the stars burned brighter than Kaelion had ever seen. An unfamiliar constellation flickered into existence, and with it came a deep, unshakable dread. Kaelion rushed to find Eluna, only to discover that she had vanished without a trace. Search parties scoured the woods, but days turned into weeks, and no sign of her was ever found. Some whispered that she had been taken by dark forces, others believed she had wandered too far and perished. But Kaelion knew in their heart that the stars had tried to warn them, and Kaelion had failed to understand.

Wrecked by guilt and sorrow, Kaelion could no longer bear to stay among their people. They left the tribe behind and sought solitude deep in the untouched wilds, turning to the land and sky for answers. Years passed in isolation, their only companions the whispering wind and the cold, distant stars.

But now, the stars have begun to shift once more. The same, strange constellation that appeared the night Eluna vanished has returned, its light pulsing with an unspoken message. Kaelion knows this is no coincidence. The time for mourning is over - **they must seek the truth**.

Taking up their quarterstaff and the wisdom of the heavens, Kaelion sets out once more. Whether it leads to redemption or ruin, they will follow the stars wherever they may guide them.

# Character Quirks
1. **Starry-Eyed Dreamer** - Kaelion often loses themselves staring at the night sky, mid-conversation, mid-battle, or even mid-bite. They'll pause, eyes locked on a constellation, muttering, "*Strange... that star wasnt there last week*"
2. **Symbolic Rituals** - Kaelion has a habit of **drawing constellations in the dirt** or carving them into wood when deep in thought. When nervous, they might trace a star shape on their wrist with their finger.
3. **Cryptic but Playful** - They have a way of speaking in vague, mysterious phrases, even when it's unnecessary
	1. "*The stars whisper of many paths... but sure, let's take the left one*"
	2. They sometimes exaggerate their "mystical wisdom" to mess with people, only to wink after.
4. **Odd Sleeping Habits** - Kaelion **sleeps outside whenever possible**, even if there's a perfectly good inn, they'd rather be under the stars. Indoors, they position themselves by a windows, restless if they can't see the night sky.
5. **Celestial Cooking** - They like to **align their meals with the phases of the moon** (e.g. only eating certain herbs or brewing specific teas during certain lunar cycles.) Whether or not it actually changes anything... well, they insist it does.
6. **Unshakably Calm... Until they don't have their Quarterstaff**  -Kaelion is typically serene and wise, but if someone misplaces or damages their **quarterstaff** (which they hand-carved with star patterns together with Eluna), they get **unexpectedly flustered** and dramatic.

# Parental Relationships
## Mother - Sylwen Starbloom
Sylwen is a Druid and a Skywatcher Elder

- A **stoic and wise** elven woman, deeply respected in the tribe for her celestial readings and connection to the land.
- She was **a guiding but distant presence** in Kaelion's life, expecting them to embrace their role as a druid and protector of the stars.
- Kaelion **adores her but also resents the pressure** she placed on them, feeling as though their destiny was decided before they could choose.
- She never fully approved of Kaelion's deep bond with **Eluna**, believing their friendship was a distraction from their sacred duties.

## Father - Therion Sylren
Therion was a Hunter and Storyteller

- A **warm, charming**, and somewhat carefree hunter who believed that wile the stars guide, *people make their own choices*.
- He **told Kaelion stories of the stars** not just as cosmic fate, but as legends of adventure, heroes, and fools who dared to challenge destiny.
- Unlike Sylwen, he **encouraged Kaelion's curiosity** and independence, often sneaking them out of ritual lessons to watch meteor showers together.
- He was **Kaelion's emotional anchor**, balancing their mother's discipline with humor and love
- His **death** is something Kaelion rarely talks about, perhaps it was the first time they felt like the stars had truly abandoned them.


## Relationships and Bonds
1. **Eluna (Lost Loved One)**
	1. Their **best friend, possibly first love** Kaelion lost. Their disappearance still haunts Kaelion.
	2. Shared a love for the **stars, adventure, and fate**, but where Kaelion was cautious, Eluna was **bold, reckless, and always chasing the unknown**.
	3. Their final conversation before disappearing was a **disagreement about destiny**, Kaelion saw omens in the stars, while Eluna **refused to be bound by fate**.
	4. Now, Kaelion wonders: *Was she right? Did she escape fate... or become a victim of it*.





# Backstory version 2

### Kaelion Sylren - The Starborn Seeker
Kaelion Sylren was born under a sky of **falling stars**, a celestial omen that foretold great significance. The **Skywatchers of the High Forest**, an ancient tribe of wood elves, believed that the heavens wove the tapestry of fate, and those who could read the stars, could catch glimpses of the future. It was said that those born under extraordinary celestial events were destined for something great- something extraordinary. This meant that Kaelion's destiny was intertwined with the stars themselves, as if Kaelion was written into the very fabric of the cosmos. From a young age they have felt this connection deep in their bones, as though the heavens themselves were speaking directly to Kaelion.

Growing up in the heart of the **High Forest**, a vast and untouched wilderness, Kaelion was drawn to the mysteries of the night sky. As a child, they would often wander from the safety of their family's home, slipping into the cool night air to gaze up at the stars. With every nightfall, they felt the pull of the sky-its patterns, its hidden meanings. Kaelion would trace constellations, carefully sketching the observations into an old, worn journal, convinced that each star held a secret to be discovered. These quiet, solitary moments under the vast canopy of stars were Kaelion's greatest joy, and it was during these nights that they first met **[[Eluna Stormwhisper]]**, a fellow Skywatcher apprentice.

### Eluna - The Guiding Light
Eluna was everything that Kaelion wasn't. Where Kaelion was intuitive, feeling their way through the mysteries of the world, Eluna was meticulous, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a determination to understand the hidden truths of the stars. Unlike the rest of the tribe, who seemed to grasp the celestial arts with natural ease, Eluna had to work tirelessly to connect with the heavens. Yet it was this very dedication that Kaelion admired-Eluna's drive was infectious, and the two quickly became inseparable. They spent their days together, training in the druidic arts, learning how to speak to the land and commune with the natural world. Their nights were spent mapping the heavens, tracing the paths of the stars, searching for meaning in the ever-changing sky.

The bond between Kaelion and Eluna grew stronger with each passing season. The two were more than companions; they were partners, friends, and, perhaps unknowingly, two souls bound by the very stars they studied. They often spoke about destiny and adventure, dreaming of the day they would leave the High Forest behind, exploring the world beyond the trees. Eluna, more than anyone, understood Kaelion's deep connection to the celestial world and was always there to challenge their assumptions, push them to learn more, to see beyond the obvious.

Eluna was Kaelion's light in the darkness- the one person who knew Kaelion inside and out, who shared their passion for the stars and their dreams of a world full of discovery. Together they were unstoppable, a force that seemed destined for greatness.

But as the seasons passed, something ominous began to stir in the heavens. The stars seemed to shift, becoming restless, as if preparing to reveal something the world was not ready to know.

### The Night of the Omen
One evening, as Kaelion and Eluna gazed up at the sky, a sudden flash of light caught their attention. An unfamiliar constellation flickered into existence, its patterns unlike any Kaelion had seen before. At first, it was faint, a brief flash of light among the familiar stars. But then it pulsed, a steady, rhythmic glow that seemed to pulse with an unspoken energy. Kaelion's heart skipped a beat, there was something deeply wrong with the stars that night, something they couldn't explain, yet it gnawed at Kaelion's very soul.
